    <h1>Netflix Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>
      Netflix offers a personalized subscription service that allows our subscribers to access
      entertainment content (hereinafter "Netflix content") over the Internet on certain televisions,
      computers, and other devices connected to the Internet ("Netflix-compatible devices").
      <br/><br/>
      These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. For the purposes of these Terms of Use,
      "Netflix service," "our service," or "the service" refer to the personalized digital content
      service provided by Netflix to find and access Netflix content, including all its features and
      functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites and user interfaces, as well as all
      content and software associated with our service. References to "you/your" in these Terms of Use
      refer to the subscriber who created the Netflix account and whose payment method is charged the
      subscription fee.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <!-- -------------------LIST 1------------------------------------------------------- -->
      <li>
        <div class="one">
          <p><b>Subscription</b></p>
          <p>1.1. Your subscription to Netflix will continue until its conclusion. To use the Netflix service,
            you must have internet access and a Netflix-compatible device and provide us with one or more
            payment methods. "Payment Method" is an accepted, valid, and current form of payment that you
            can update as needed and may include payment through your account with third parties. Unless
            you cancel your subscription prior to the billing date, you authorize us to charge the
            subscription fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).</p>
          <p>1.2. On certain occasions, we present you with various subscription plans, including subscriptions
            offered by third parties in combination with the provision of their own products and services.
            Some subscription plans may have different terms and limitations, which will be disclosed
            when you sign up or in other communications you can refer to. You can find more details about
            your Netflix subscription by visiting the netflix.com website, clicking on the "Account" link at
            the top of the pages, below your profile name.</p>

      <!-- -------------------LIST 2------------------------------------------------------- -->
      <li>
        <div class="two">
          <p><b>Promotional Offers.</b> Occasionally, we offer you promotions, plans, or special subscriptions
            ("Offers"). Netflix determines if you meet the eligibility requirements for Offers at its sole
            discretion, and we reserve the right to cancel the Offer and block your account if we determine
            that you do not meet the eligibility requirements. Subscribers in households with an existing or
            recent Netflix subscription may not be eligible for certain welcome Offers. We may use information
            such as device identifiers, Payment Method, or email address associated with an existing or recent
            Netflix subscription to determine if the user can opt for the Offer. Eligibility requirements and
            other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign up for the Offer or in other
            communications you can refer to.</p>

        <div class="three">
          <p><b>Billing and Cancellation</b></p>
          <p>3.1. <u>Billing Cycle.</u> The subscription fee for the Netflix service will be charged to your Payment
            Method on the payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will
            depend on the type of subscription you chose when registering for the service. In some cases, the
            billing date may change, such as if your Payment Method is not set up correctly, if you have
            changed your subscription plan, or if your payment subscription started on a nonexistent day in a
            given month. Visit the netflix.com website and click on the "Billing Details" link on the "Account"
            page to see the date of your next payment. If you subscribed to Netflix using your account with a
            third party as a Payment Method, you can check the billing details related to your Netflix
            subscription by visiting your account with the corresponding third party.</p>
          <p>3.2. <u>Payment Methods.</u> To use the Netflix service, you must provide one or more Payment Methods.
            If your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available for us to charge your
            subscription fee, you authorize us to charge you through any other Payment Method associated with
            your account. You will remain responsible for any amount not charged. If we are unable to collect an
            amount (for reasons such as the expiration of your Payment Method, insufficient funds, or any other
            reason) and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have
            collected the debt through a valid Payment Method. The issuer of some Payment Methods may charge you
            certain fees for things like foreign currency transactions or other charges related to the
            processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used.
            Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</p>
          <p>3.3. <u>Updating Your Payment Methods.</u> You can update your Payment Methods on the "Account" page.
            We may also update your Payment Methods according to the data provided by the payment service
            providers. After each update, you authorize us to continue charging you through the relevant Payment
            Method or Methods.</p>
          <p>3.4. <u>Cancellation.</u> You can cancel your Netflix subscription at any time, and you will still have
            access to the Netflix service until the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable, and
            we do not provide refunds or credits for partial subscription periods or unused Netflix content. To
            cancel your subscription, go to the "Account" page and follow the cancellation instructions. If you
            cancel your subscription, your account will be automatically closed at the end of your current billing
            period. To see when your account will be closed, click on "Billing Details" on the "Account" page. If
            you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and want to
            cancel your Netflix subscription, you may need to do so through that third party. For example, you
            may need to visit your account with the corresponding third party and disable the automatic renewal
            of the Netflix service or unsubscribe from it through that third party.</p>
          <p>3.5. <u>Changes in Prices and Subscription Plans.</u> We may change our subscription plans and their
            prices as we deem appropriate. However, no price change or change in your subscription plan will take
            effect within the first 30 days after we have notified you. If you do not want to accept the price
            change or change in your subscription plan, you can cancel your subscription before the change takes
            effect.</p>

        <div class="four">
          <p><b>Netflix Service</b></p>
          <p>4.1. To subscribe to the Netflix service, you must be 18 years old. Minors can only use the service
            under the supervision and responsibility of an adult.</p>
          <p>4.2. The Netflix service and all content accessed through the service are for your personal and
            non-commercial use and cannot be shared with individuals who do not live in your household unless
            allowed by your subscription plan. During your Netflix subscription, we grant you a limited,
            non-exclusive, and non-transferable right to access the Netflix service and Netflix content.
            Except as mentioned, no right, title, or benefit will be transferred to you. You agree not to use
            the service for public displays.</p>
          <p>4.3. You can access Netflix content primarily within the country where you have established your
            account and only in the geographic locations where we offer your subscription plan and have
            licensed such content. Available content varies depending on the geographic location and changes
            periodically. There is Netflix content not available in the ad-supported subscription plan. The
            number of devices on which you can simultaneously view content depends on your subscription plan
            and is specified on the "Account" page.</p>
          <p>4.4. The Netflix service, including the content library, is regularly updated. In addition, we
            continuously analyze various aspects of our service, including our websites, user interfaces, and
            promotional features. You can stop participating in tests at any time. Just go to the "Account" page
            and change the "Participation in Tests" setting.</p>
          <p>4.5. Depending on your subscription plan, some Netflix content may be available for temporary
            download and offline viewing on certain compatible devices ("Offline Titles"). There are certain
            limitations, including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number
            of devices that can hold Offline Titles, the time period you have to start watching Offline Titles,
            and how long Offline Titles will be accessible. Certain Offline Titles may not be playable in
            certain countries, and if you connect in a country where you cannot stream that Offline Title, that
            Offline Title cannot be played while you are in that country.</p>
          <p>4.6. Unless explicitly authorized by us, you agree not to:</p>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>archive, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, present, publish, license, create derivative
              works, sell, or use content or information contained in the Netflix service or obtained through
              it;</li>
            <li>bypass, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade, block, hide, or thwart any content protections or
              other elements of the Netflix service, including the user interface, any advertising or
              advertising function, copyright notices, and trademarks;</li>
            <li>use any kind of robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access the Netflix
              service;</li>
            <li>decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble any computer program or other products or
              processes accessible from the Netflix service;</li>
            <li>introduce any kind of code or product or manipulate the content of the Netflix service in any
              way;</li>
            <li>use any mining, collection, or data extraction method;</li>
            <li>upload, post, email, or transmit by any other means any material designed to interrupt,
              destroy, or limit the functionality of any software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment
              associated with the Netflix service, including any computer viruses or other computer code,
              files, or programs.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We may terminate or restrict your use of our service if you violate these Terms of Use or engage in
            illegal or fraudulent use of the service.</p>
          <p>4.7. The viewing quality of Netflix content may vary by device and may be affected by various factors
            such as your location, available bandwidth, and/or the speed of your internet connection. The
            availability of High Definition (HD), Ultra High Definition (Ultra HD), and High Dynamic Range (HDR)
            depends on your internet service and the capabilities of your Netflix-compatible device. Not all
            content is available in all formats, such as HD, Ultra HD, or HDR, and not all subscription plans
            allow you to receive content in all formats. The minimum connection speed for HD video quality
            (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher) is 3.0 Mbps per stream. However, we recommend higher
            speed for better video quality. A connection speed of at least 5.0 Mbps per stream is recommended
            for receiving Full HD video quality (defined as a resolution of 1080p or higher). A connection
            speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per stream is recommended for receiving Ultra HD video quality
            (defined as a resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all internet connection
            charges. Check with your internet service provider for information on possible internet data usage
            charges. The time it takes for Netflix content to start playing varies depending on various
            factors, including your location, available bandwidth at that time, the content you selected, and
            your Netflix-compatible device's settings.</p>
          <p>4.8. The Netflix software has been developed by Netflix or for Netflix and can only be used for
            authorized streaming and to access Netflix content through Netflix-compatible devices. This
            software may vary by device and medium, and its features may also differ between devices. You
            acknowledge that the use of the service may require third-party software subject to licenses from
            those third parties. You agree that you may automatically receive updated versions of the Netflix
            software and related third-party software.</p>

          <p><b>Various Provisions</b></p>
          <p>6.1. <u>Unsolicited Materials,</u> Netflix does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas for

          <p>6.4. <u>Changes in Terms of Use.</u> Netflix may change these Terms of Use as it deems
            appropriate. We will notify you at least 30 days before those changes affect you. If you do not want
